I had hosting problem due to strapi. Therefore, you can access the video of the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhTWLY9Pr0U/) instead of the live demo.

react.js | tailwind css | strapi | redux toolkit | stripe

starting guide:

after cloning the project, you should type the following commands in the terminal:

react_shop\api> npm run develop (this command start strapi server)
react_shop\client> npm run start
